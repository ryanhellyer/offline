Modern browsers include offline caching functionality. The Offline cache plugin for WordPress allows you to easily implement this.


== Description ==

Websites typically require an internet connection to work. Modern browsers do however include offline caching functionality via their cache manifest functionality. It is possible to set a website to cache itself inside the browser when loaded, so that if you need to revisit the page when it is offline, you may do so.

The Offline cache plugin for WordPress allows you to easily implement this functionality on your own website.

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= But how can you view  a web page if you aren't online??? =
Well you can with this plugin ;) You just need to visit the page at least once.

= How do I make it download my whole site? =
That is not currently possible with the current iteration of the plugin, but it is theoretically possible. Implementing this into a generic plugin is quite tricky, hence I haven't added that functionality into this iteration. I have added a filter to the 

= Why are only some pages/files are caching? =
That's probably because you have hit the cache limit of your device. Different browser/device combinations have different limits on how much content you can store in the cache.


= Where's the plugin settings page? =

There isn't one.


= Does it work in older versions of WordPress? =

Probably, but I only actively support the latest version of WordPress. Support for older versions is purely by accident.


= I need custom functionality. Can we pay you to build it for us? =

No, I'm too busy. Having said that, if you are willing to pay me a small fortune then I could <a href="https://ryan.hellyer.kiwi/contact/">probably be persuaded</a>. I'm also open to suggestions for improvements, so feel free to send me ideas and if you are lucky, it may be added for free :)
